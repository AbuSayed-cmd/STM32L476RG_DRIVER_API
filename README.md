# STM32L476_GPIO_DRIVER_API
## The development of API of GPIOx Peripheral
In this file I have developed an API for GPIOx Driver Peripheral by using STM32L476RG Nucleo Micro-controller.
By using this Driver API, We can configure -
* GPIOx Initialization
* Enable/Disable GPIOx Port Clock
* Read from GPIOx pin
* Write GPIOx Pin
* Alternate Functionality

In the Drivers folder, you will get source and Header files of the Driver API.

## Used Software 
STM32CubeIDE
