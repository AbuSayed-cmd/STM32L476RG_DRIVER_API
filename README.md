# STM32L476_DRIVER_API(GPIOX, SPI)
## The development of API of GPIOx Peripheral
In this file I have developed a GPIOx Driver API Peripheral for STM32L476RG Nucleo Micro-controller.
By using this Driver API, We can configure -
* GPIOx Initialization
* Enable/Disable GPIOx Port Clock
* Read from GPIOx pin
* Write GPIOx Pin
* Alternate Functionality

## The development of API of SPIx Peripheral
In this file I have developed a SPIx Driver API Peripheral for STM32L476RG Nucleo Micro-controller.
By using this Driver API, We can configure -
* SPIx Initialization
* SPI Tx
* SPI Rx
* SPI Interrupt Configuration and Handling(No Implemented)

**For More info, Please check SPI Readme file **
**NOTE:**
**We can use Header File package developed by STMicroelectronics, can write the progam with less Effort**

## Used Software 
STM32CubeIDE
